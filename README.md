<h1 id=intro>Introduction</h1>
This codebook contains the description of the variables that was included in the project assignment for week 4. 
For this assignment, I only included the variables that was generated using the <code>mean()</code> and <code>std()</code> function.
I followed some of the lecture's principle of naming variables (No underscores,, no dashes no white spaces, and no duplications).
